# Rotten-Tomatoes-Linear-Regression

A project I wrote in R for my Analytics Data Models class where I build a model ro find if a relationship exists between the critics' Rotten Tomatoes scores and the users' using a simple linear regression model. I used RStudio to create this project and have the fivethirtyeight, ggplot2, dplyr and tidyr libraries installed to set up my project. 

I follow a simple 4 step process whenever I do Exploratory Data Analysis on a dataset:

1. Become familiar with the data
2. Describe the Data
3. Transform the Data
4. Formulate theories

Perhaps the project format could be easy and straightforward for you when you do your own story-telling? Simply open RStudio -> File -> New File -> R Markdown. Then you are ready to rock and roll!

Once you have completed your Exploratory Data Analysis, you can run your project to ensure that your code is working properly and that the visualizations appear correctly. Then knit to whichever format you prefer (I'm partial to Word).
